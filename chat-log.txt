Alright leme check it out

So you need me to setup the database + a api for the database or queries that can be mapped to those outfit functions that u can call in game? 
LuaBearyGood — 7/20/2025 3:57 PM
yes exactly
if you go in catalog avatar creator
we’re basically trying to recreate the community outfits browser
so we need all the apis in the document which can be called from roblox
if you could make a roblox sided sdk that would probably be best, but if not i can build that
Mr. Stark — 7/20/2025 6:13 PM
I can try to do that too yea, will look into the roblox documentation
LuaBearyGood — 7/20/2025 6:46 PM
do you have any further questions and how much would you charge to build a system like this
Mr. Stark — 7/20/2025 7:33 PM
I'm not a 100% sure if I can make it because I'm more of a web dev with some roblox dev experience (still learning roblox dev side) but I'll try to integrate it all. 

Do u need a specefic kind of database like supabase or postgres sql specefically or doesn't matter as long as u can call the apis and store & retrieve data? 

Also all the json / object fields are in the pdf right? anything else u wana add?

Also do I host the database & external api endpoints for it? How many average requests u think would it make? (So can configure the server based on that)

How fast do u need it built, whats your deadline?

Currently we're with a company called hostinger, however if you have a preference that will cost us a similar amount we're happy to switch. We dont mind so much so long as the apis for storing / retreiving data work.

Yes, the only thing to take note of is the actual blob of outfit metadata, that may contain more keys and values.

We can host it, and you just built it. Or you can host it and we can pay you monthly- up to you. Im assuming its easier for us to host it. We need about 100GB of storage and unlimited bandwidth we want to be able to do at least a couple million requests a day to start with- with the option to scale up.

We need it built within 2 weeks

Alright, sounds good. Given the requirements and timeline, I can get it done for $150.

Yea, I'm okay with Hostinger VPS and setup the database and apis there, I believe kvm 2 comes with 100GB storage & 8TB bandwidth per month, so we should be set there as its probably plenty of bandwith for just metadata.

Also just to clarify, you need the metadata to be flexible with dynamic keys and values so u can add more as needed?
LuaBearyGood — 7/20/2025 10:56 PM
That would be best yes
Mr. Stark — 7/20/2025 10:56 PM
Alright I'll try to get it done asap and build a roblox sdk for it if possible too
LuaBearyGood — 7/20/2025 10:58 PM
Do you need anything more from me?
or are you ok to start
Mr. Stark — 7/20/2025 10:58 PM
I think I am but if I need anything I'll ask
